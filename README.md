# Varrefvals

I know, it's too LOL wanting PHP coding without $ sign on its variable name. But, writing code with $ sign on every variable is adding typing complexity, for me. I wish I could do coding using simple syntax only. So I decided to design and write simple program that can be used for compiling no $ sign code into normal PHP code.
