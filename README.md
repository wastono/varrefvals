# Varrefvals

I know, it's too LOL wanting PHP coding without $ sign on its variable name. But, writing code with $ sign on every variable is adding typing complexity, for me. I wish I could do coding using simple syntax only. So I decided to design and write simple program that can be used for compiling no $ sign code into normal PHP code.

**Varrefvals**, that's the name that I use for this program. It comes from 3 selected keywords: `var`, `ref`, and `vals`. `var` keyword is used as direct variable declaration. `ref` keyword is used for setting variable accessed by reference. `vals` keyword is used for setting variables accessed by value.
